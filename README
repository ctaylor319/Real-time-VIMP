Capstone project for Georgia Tech's MS-ROBO program. This repository implements hzyu17's motion-planning-as-variational-inference, or VIMP, algorithm as part of an autonomous control package. It is designed to be deployable to both simulated and real-world robots. By utilizing a 3D lidar sensor (or another equivalent), this package will plan and control a robot to reach a goal while mapping its environment.
